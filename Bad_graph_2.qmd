#### Bad Graph 2

**Tourist Generating Countries to United States of America**

![](Bad_graph_2.jpg){align="middle"}

This graph is a U-shaped ribbon design that represents the top 20 tourist-generating countries that visit the United States.

-   **Key Elements**: Country Flags and Names Each country is representative of their flag, name, and Tourist Number.

-   **Ribbon design**: The ribbon does the work of visually linking the countries; however, it does not have any specific predefined structure to the design.

-   **Order**: By the number of tourists, though hard to decipher from this visualization

#### Why is this graph not effective?

1.  **Confusing Design**: Ribbon hard to follow for tourist numbers. Perhaps a bar chart could be more intuitive.

2.  **Cluttered**: Twisting path and tightly fit labels in graph make graph hard to read.

3.  **Inconsistent Scaling**: Because the size of countries has nothing to do with the amount of tourists, large discrepancies - such as between Canada and Mexico - are not resolved.

4.  **No Visual Metric**: The number of tourists is shown only as text; there is no visual metric (like a bar).

5.  **Non-Linear Layout**: There's no hierarchy in the ribbon - hence comparisons are challenging.

6.  **Over-Use of Colors**: Colors add no information, resulting in a graph that is more complicated than it needs to be.

```{r, echo=FALSE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(readxl)
data1 <- read_excel("data1.xlsx")

p1 <- ggplot(data1, aes(x = reorder(Country, -Number_of_Tourists), y = Number_of_Tourists, fill = Continent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + 
  labs(title = "Number of Tourists by Country", x = "Country", y = "Number of Tourists") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Asia" = "chocolate4", 
    "Europe" = "cadetblue", 
    "North America" = "darkmagenta", 
    "South America" = "darkseagreen4", 
    "Africa" = "aquamarine4", 
    "Oceania" = "brown"
  )) +
  theme_minimal()

interactive_plot <- ggplotly(p1)
interactive_plot  

```

#### Why is this a good chart?

1.  **Clear design**: it is very easy to compare tourist figures by means of the horizontal bars. Long bars mean more tourists and provide faster feedback visually

2.  **Color-coding by Continent**: Each color represents the different continents that those countries belong to, such as yellow for Europe and red for Asia. That allows a viewer to see at a glance where the most tourists come from.

3.  **Good Use of Available Space**: Bars are placed in order with no unnecessary crowding or overlapping.

4.  **Balance in Visualization:** The largest values (Mexico and Canada) leap off the screen without overpowering the smaller values.

5.  **Easy Legend**: The color coding is described in the legend, and by it, one may easily relate every country to its respective continent.

#### Graph Insights

From this "Number of Tourists by Country" bar chart, we can identify that:

1.  Top Contributors: The United States receives the most tourists from Canada and Mexico, represented by the longest bars.

2.  Continental Breakdown: North America is in the lead, colored in green, followed by Europe, colored in yellow, then Asia in red.

3.  Smaller Contributors: Countries like New Zealand and Switzerland send less tourists, as depicted by shorter bars.

4.  Easy comparison: Such a chart makes it easy to compare the number of tourists from one country with those from another.

5.  Global representation: The graph represents the tourists coming to the United States from the rest of the world.

This map very clearly shows which countries send the most and fewest numbers of tourists to the United States, arranged by continents.

```{r, echo=FALSE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(rnaturalearth)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(readxl)
data1 <- read_excel("data1.xlsx")

world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")


merged_data <- world %>%
  left_join(data1, by = c("name" = "Country"))


# Using a custom gradient with multiple colors
p <- ggplot(merged_data) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Number_of_Tourists, text = paste("Country:", name, "<br>Tourists:", scales::comma(Number_of_Tourists)))) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colors = c("lightblue", "yellow", "red", "chocolate4"), 
    labels = scales::comma
  ) +

#### Why is this a good chart?

1.  **Global Overview**: It clearly shows which nations send the most tourists.

2.  **Color Gradient**: The blue-to-yellow scale clearly indicates which countries have more tourists, like the United States, Canada, and Australia.

3.  **Easy-to-understand Legend**: Itself shows how much the number of tourists for each color is. 

4.  **Efficient Usage of Space**: It shows all countries on this map without it being confusing or cluttered. 

5.  **Simplicity in Design**: Its minimalist design helps draw the attention of a viewer to presented data.

#### Graph Insights

The "Number of Tourists by Country" heat map may indicate the following:

1.  Top Contributors: Canada, Mexico, and Australia will lead the numbers of tourists coming to the United States. These will be shown in yellow.

2.  Regional Trends: The highest numbers of tourists are found to come from the regions of North America, Europe, and Oceania.

3.  Lower Contributors: Somber colors will be used for countries in Africa and parts of Asia, which yield lower numbers.

4.  Easy Comparison: The gradient in color will ensure ease of comparison of each country's contribution of tourists in a swift manner.

5.  Global View: The map represents the fact that tourists are coming from all the corners of the world, though with huge differences in quantity.

This map aptly identifies which countries send the most and least tourists to the United States of America in a world-wide context.
