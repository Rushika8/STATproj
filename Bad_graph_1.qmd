#### Bad Graph 1

**Dept Ratio: Total Liabilities/Total Assets**

![](Bad_graph_1.jpg){width="1430"}

This map compares states' debt ratios-total liabilities divided by total assets-along with the dollar amount of those liabilities.

-   **Size of the bubble**: This indicates the size of the total liability such that the larger the bubble, the larger the liability.

-   **Color Gradient**: Green represents low debt ratios, red represents high debt ratios, and neutral colors represent middle levels.

-   **Red represents the states with a high debt ratio**: For example, Illinois and New Jersey are very high, while Texas and Florida are rather low.

#### Why is this a bad graph :

1.  **Double Encoding Confusion**: Size and color are two different measurements, and it's hard to focus on both.

2.  **Overlapping Bubbles**: States-especially for densely populated areas like the Northeast-overlap and are hard to read.

3.  **No Clear Scale**: Color gradient does not have numeric scale helping to explain debt ratio numbers.

4.  **Map distortion**: Extremely large states like Texas and California dominate this map, based not on their economic condition but based on their size alone.

5.  **Misleading visuals**: States that have high liabilities but low relative debt ratios - Texas is a good example of this, might appear worse than smaller states that have much higher debt ratios.

6.  **Geographical Irrelevance**: For all practical purposes, this map says little, and the same comparison is better made via a bar chart or a dot plot.

#### Revised Chart - 1

**Total Liabilities by State: Bar Chart**

```{r, echo=FALSE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(plotly)
library(readxl)
debts <- read_excel("debts.xlsx")

bar_plot <- plot_ly(
  data = debts,
  x = ~State,
  y = ~`Total Liabilities (Billion $)`,
  type = 'bar',
  name = 'Total Liabilities',
  marker = list(color = 'darkolivegreen')  # Example with named color
) %>%
  layout(title = 'Total Liabilities by Debt',
         xaxis = list(title = 'State'),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Total Liabilities (Billion $)'))

bar_plot


```

#### Why is this a good chart?

1.  **Clear Visualization**: The bar chart allows comparison in which states have more liabilities compared to the rest.

2.  **Direct Comparison**: X-axis has states listed on it and y-axis has liabilities, so comparison is done very quick visually

3.  **Logical Scaling**: y-axis is labeled in billions, so you get an idea of an exact value.

4.  **Clean design**: It doesn't have anything superfluous, and in this graph, viewers can directly focus on the data.

5.  **Read easily**: Since it is a linear arrangement, one can easily spot states with high liabilities, like California and Texas.

#### Graph Insights

Based on the "Total Liabilities by State" bar chart, we can conclude:

1.  Large disparities: Some states have far larger liabilities than others.

2.  Top three states: California (CA), Illinois (IL), and New York (NY) have the biggest liabilities, as indicated by the tall bars.

3.  Low-Liability States: Wyoming (WY), Vermont (VT), and South Dakota (SD) have very low liabilities, shown by their short bars.

4.  Easy Comparison: The chart clearly illustrates which states have the highest and lowest obligations.

5.  Concentration: The majority of liabilities are concentrated in a few states, with the others having modest or low levels.

This graph allows you to simply compare state liabilities and discover those with the most financial responsibilities.

**Total Liabilities by U.S. State Geospatial Map**

```{r, echo=FALSE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
debts <- read_excel("debts.xlsx")


custom_colorscale <- list(
  c(0, 'lightyellow'),   # Low values
  c(0.25, 'khaki'),      # Mid-low values
  c(0.5, 'gold'),        # Mid values
  c(0.75, 'darkgoldenrod'), # Mid-high values
  c(1, 'darkred')          # High values
)



choropleth_map <- plot_ly(
  data = debts,
  locations = ~State, 
  locationmode = 'USA-states',
  z = ~`Total Liabilities (Billion $)`, 
  type = 'choropleth',
  colorscale = custom_colorscale, 
  colorbar = list(title = "Total Liabilities (Billion $)")
) %>%
  layout(
    title = 'Total Liabilities by U.S. State',
    geo = list(
      scope = 'usa',
      projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),
      showlakes = TRUE, 
      lakecolor = toRGB('white')
    )
  )

#### Why is this a good chart?

1.  **Geographical Context**: You can compare state liabilities with one other while still seeing geographical context.

2.  **Color Gradient**: Darker blue represents more liabilities, lighter blue, less. You get an idea from a glance which states owe more than others.

3.  **Clear Legend**: The chart conveys liability ranges, which prohibits one from misjudging the data.

4.  **Clean Design**: It's just a map without irrelevant details, making it look cluttered; it is all about data.

5.  **In an Instant**: You get quick insights through color-coding-for instance, knowing which states are high-reliability by the darker blue without reading the numbers.

#### Graph Insights

Based on this "Total Liabilities by U.S. State" map we may draw the following conclusions:

1.  Regional Differences: Each state is in a different shade because each state displays a different level of liabilities, in a range of blues.

2.  High-Liability States: The states of Michigan (MI) and California (CA) display the highest liabilities shown in dark blue.

3.  Low-Liability States: Lighter blue states - often in the Midwest and West - have lower liabilities.

4.  Easy to Compare: Due to a color gradient, liabilities of different states are easily compared to one another.

This map clearly depicts those states with financial liabilities that are either the highest or the lowest.
